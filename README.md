### 🔍 Component Explanation

#### 1️⃣ User Input (Keyboard Events)

This layer represents **physical keyboard interactions** generated by the user.
All captured inputs originate from **explicit user actions** on the system.

> In an academic context, this layer helps understand how low-level input events are generated by the OS.

---

#### 2️⃣ Input Listener (Key Capture)

This component is responsible for **listening to keyboard events** at runtime.

* Captures keystrokes in real time
* Operates only while the program is running
* No hidden background execution

📌 *Educational value:*
Understanding how input hooks work and how security software detects them.

---

#### 3️⃣ Core Controller (`main.py`)

The **central logic unit** of the application.

Responsibilities:

* Coordinates all modules
* Manages application lifecycle
* Applies ethical constraints
* Ensures controlled execution

This layer acts as the **brain of the system**.

---

#### 4️⃣ Logging Module

Stores captured data **locally and transparently**.

Characteristics:

* No remote exfiltration
* No encryption bypass
* No stealth persistence
* Logs are readable for analysis

📌 *Purpose:*
To analyze how logged data looks and how defenders can detect it.

---

#### 5️⃣ User Interface (`interface.py`)

A **visible and interactive control panel**.

Functions:

* Start / Stop key capture
* User awareness and consent
* Manual control over execution

This design choice enforces **ethical compliance** by ensuring:

* No silent execution
* No hidden monitoring
* Full user control

---

### 🛡️ Ethical Design Principles Embedded

* ✔️ Transparency
* ✔️ User consent
* ✔️ No persistence at boot
* ✔️ No stealth behavior
* ✔️ Educational intent only

### 🎓 Academic Relevance

This architecture allows students to:

* Study how keyloggers are structured
* Understand attack surfaces
* Learn how defensive tools detect such behavior
* Analyze runtime process behavior safely

> *“Understanding the architecture of threats is essential to defending against them.”*
